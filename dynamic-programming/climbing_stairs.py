"""
the problem of findindg the number of steps needed to climb the stair case 
one and two steps can be taken at a time 
the steps with same number but different order are consider differnt
"""

#the problem can be vislauized using a tree soln which the root will be the number of the stps we are in 
#the edge will be the steps that we took to reach there 
#using the recursion and depth first search 
#we can use the DP for the storage of the steps so the steps are not repeacted
