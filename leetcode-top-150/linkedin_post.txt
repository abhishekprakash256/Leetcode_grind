The year 2024 has come to an end and there are some highlights and accomplishment which I have done this year. Couple of milestones I have achieved this year which seems impossible before but through persistance and perverance work I was able to accomplish couple of them. So here is a highlight --- 


Completed 150 question in Leetcode --

This was a long term goal to complete and a part of job preprations as well . The Completion of 150 quetions took about 3-4 months of continous everyday work with learning new concepts and grinding on old concepts as well. The process was rigrous and slow but the concepts and topics seems impossible to do before now seems throughtout clear. The topics seems most worth spending time for is dynamic programming and graph problems. Even though I was doing leetcode and DSA from a long time I was not being consistent and everytime I gave up after sometime as encounter some tough topics . This time the approach was just tackle one problem for a day even in busiset day and keep going and don't give up and don't get stuck on the problem for long, learn the pattern and move to the next problem. I also achioved one more milestone of leetcode 100 days badge for the year 2024. With this I am not stopping rightnow for 150 questions the goal for next year to cover 400 questions in total inlcuing more hard questions as well and just keep going one at a time. 

Building my Personal Portfolio Website --

This was a long time goal for me to build my portfolio from scratch but never gotten time and enough courage to start the project. So this year in Jan I started the project with no pre planning and just design some wireframe design on board and start the code for front end . Before even that I selected some frame work that I am gonna use so for the front end I decided bootstrap cause I have used before and for the backend I used Flask. The process statrted very slow and a lot of designing decisions I have to take which was challenging at the start but later I statred to enjoy those process. The process also made me learn about the front-end and backend end which was unexplored for me. So a lot of learning happend and new areas I have developed myself.

The learning happend on these sides --
- Database design (mongodb)
- Frontend Design (Bootstrap, JS)
- Backend Design (Flask)
- Cloud Inffrasture development (CI-CD, AWS)
- Testing 

The next step for me is learning REACT framework for the frontend development, so for the moudulartization of the persoanl portfolio. The building is already on progress and testing each module. The design of the new website differs a litte but not drastically. The backend is also made in packages so the code can be resusbale and depend are easy to manage. I am also using REACT so that new functionalty can be implemnt as well in future and then make new projects based on that.


Doing 10k run-- 

I also completed a 10K run that was a mile stone to do. It was a good experience and I pushed myself a lot. There was not much practice done before the run but  still I was able to complete the run. It helped me to boost my health and my mental health as well as last year I was battling with some mental health issues but this year I found much more peace and calmed in myself. 


Lots of Networking -- 

This year I also incorportaed a new starategy for newtorking that helped me to connect with a lot of good indivuals. I statered this starategy back in September where I started to find people on linkedin and send them perosnalized message to get thier connection and some are kind enough that I was even able to talk to them as well. My connection rise from 800 to 1600+ in just 3-4 months. 

System Design -- 

Back in Jan 2024 I also started stydying system design and that opened my mind on the way I used to see the software . I started with Alex Xu book on system design and then jumped to eduactive couse on system design I used some other article to study as well. These all helped me to develop good understanding of the softeare develeopment and when I designed my website, I use the concepts as well. Based on the study I also made two prohject one is a chat system and other is tiny url system . They both helped me to grab me more conecepts on the design and also grasp more in depth knbowledge of the developpemnt knowledge.


Integraion of AI on work --

The integreation of AI on work helped me a lot , with making a boiler plate code. The depends on AI has also increased as it, which seems doesn't good all the time. So now I try to balance the use of AI and my own personal skills. Some of the work that AI does is pretty remarkable but still in some places I see it lacks, it can definalty get better in future. It has defibnatly helped me a lot in the a lot of ways and makes my learning faster as well. 



Next Year Goals -- 

- Learn REACT and make all the code of front end of my website on react 
- Complete a total of 400 leetcode questions with more hard question frequecny. 
- Make more projects that can solve life problems or do soemthing better if it already exists or add more value. One have planned already that will be a colobration too where someone can coordinate with other perosonn and code together . 
- Deep dive more into system design
- Do a good open source coloboration
- Deep dive into GPT models and AI working 






üéâ 2024: A Year of Growth, Persistence, and Milestones! üöÄ  

As the year comes to an end, I wanted to reflect on some highlights and accomplishments that seemed impossible at first but were achieved through persistence and perseverance. Here's a look back at what 2024 has been all about for me:  


üß†Completed 150 LeetCode Questions 
This milestone was a long-term goal and part of my job preparation journey. Over 3-4 months, I worked consistently every single day, grinding through tough problems and learning new concepts like:  
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Problems  

This time, I adopted a different approach:  
- Solve one problem daily, no matter how busy the day was.  
- Don‚Äôt get stuck too long‚Äîlearn the pattern and move on.  

I even earned the 100 Days LeetCode badge for 2024! üöÄ The next goal is ambitious: 400 questions, including more hard-level problems.  


üåê Built My Personal Portfolio Website 
This year, I finally built my portfolio from scratch‚Äîsomething I had been postponing for years! Starting with just a wireframe design, I developed it using:  
- Frontend: Bootstrap, JavaScript  
- Backend: Flask  
- Database: MongoDB  
- Cloud Infrastructure: CI/CD and AWS  

This project was a tremendous learning experience, and next year, I plan to:  
- Learn React for modular frontend design.  
- Add new features and improve testing and modularity.  


üèÉCompleted a 10K Run  
This was more than just a physical milestone. It was a testament to improving both my mental and physical health, finding peace, and overcoming personal challenges.  


ü§ù Networking Like Never Before  
Starting in September, I adopted a personalized LinkedIn networking strategy that helped me connect with incredible professionals. My connections grew from 800 to 1600+ in just a few months, and I had the privilege of meaningful conversations with many.  


üõ†Ô∏è System Design Journey  
Diving into system design was eye-opening this year! Using resources like Alex Xu's book and online courses, I gained insights into software architecture. This knowledge helped me build projects like:  
- A Chat System 
- A TinyURL Clone 


ü§ñ Integrating AI at Work
AI became a significant part of my workflow, streamlining boilerplate code generation and speeding up learning. While I‚Äôm cautious about over-reliance, I look forward to balancing AI and personal skills better in 2025.  



üéØ Goals for 2025  
1. Learn React and refactor my portfolio's frontend.  
2. Complete a total of 400 LeetCode questions, focusing on harder problems.  
3. Create impactful projects that solve real-world problems.  
4. Collaborate on open-source projects.  
5. Deep dive into System Design and GPT Models.  
6. Push myself for more physical challenges.  

2024 was all about learning, growing, and pushing limits. Here's to a bigger, bolder, and better 2025! üéä
